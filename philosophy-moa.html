    <h2 class="section-title">Institutional Philosophy</h2>

    <p class="section-text">
      Anandmayee Institute for Entrepreneurship Development &amp; Research (AIEDR)

      are fundamental drivers of sustainable economic development, institutional
      resilience, and societal progress.
    </p>

    <p class="section-text">
      The Institute adopts a public-purpose orientation, recognizing education
      and research as long-term national assets rather than commercial products.

      Section 8 of the Companies Act, 2013, ensuring that all resources are
      applied exclusively toward educational and research objectives.

    <p class="section-text">
      AIEDR’s philosophy emphasizes academic rigor, ethical governance,
      multidisciplinary learning, and real-world applicability. The Institute
      seeks to bridge gaps between theory and practice, academia and industry,
      and knowledge creation and societal application.
    </p>

    <p class="section-text">
      The Institute is committed to inclusivity, access to quality learning,
      responsible institutional governance, and long-term capacity building
